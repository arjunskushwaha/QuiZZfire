# QuiZZfire
QuiZZfire is a web based quizzing system in which questions shows up and answers can be recorded. The answering mechanism can be both multiple choice or short answer type. If the answers are stored in database then the program can automatically check the answers of the questions for multiple choice type questions.

It was a personal web development project that I made.

Technologies made use of -
1. MySQL
2. PHP
3. AJAX
4. Javascript
5. HTML

Main focus was to make backend thus the front end is made using MDB Bootstrap and I have not tried to make it better.
